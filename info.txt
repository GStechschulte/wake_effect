Assumptions:
- Airflow is parallel to wind direction along entire system
- Airflow @turbines height has direction of airflow at measure station (turbines ~40m -> measure station 60, 80, 100)

To consider:
- Airflow direction change instantly -> frome measure station to turbines
- mean windspeed variance etc.
